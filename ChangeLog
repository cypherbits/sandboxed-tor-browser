Changes in version 0.0.19 - 2019-01-31:
* Disable seccomp profiles to make this work again. It will be enable ASAP.

Changes in version 0.0.18.1 - 2018-09-11:
* FIX: Make Tor Browser 8 work again and add more debug messages.

Changes in version 0.0.18 - 2018-07-01:
 * Make it work with the new Tor Browser 8.0a9 with Firefox 60 ESR. To allow this we detect you use this version and:
 -Enable mounting /proc (for this version only).
 -Disable PGP verification (for all versions) for installations because this new alpha is signed with a new public key, this will be fixed soon.
 (Downloads are HTTPS and HPKP so this is probably not a thread)
 -Firefox 60 needs glib schemas, we mount them and some icons too... (for this version only)
 (I will filter /proc , schemas, and review seccomp for ESR60 to keep it safer in future versions)
